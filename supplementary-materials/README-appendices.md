APPENDIX A: HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS

Code development and testing took place on a desktop iMac (27-inch, Late 2012) provided by the UNC
Charlotte Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics.

  – Processor: 2.9 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5
  – Memory: 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3  

Research computing resources provided by the UNC Charlotte Research Computing
group. I used the HPC cluster, which runs Red Hat Enterprise Linux and is managed
by SLURM (https://oneit.charlotte.edu/urc/our-environment) [Internet]. Resource
requests were for one or multiple of the following nodes:
  - Dual 18-Core Intel Xeon Gold 6154 CPU @ 3.00GHz (36 cores / node)
  - 388GB RAM (10.7GB / core)
  - 100Gbit EDR Infiniband Interconnect
