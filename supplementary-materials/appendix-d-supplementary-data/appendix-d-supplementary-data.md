APPENDIX D: SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Contains four files from this investigation: a phylogenetic tree (suffix “.tree”) based
on the core genome of 817 E. coli isolates as determined by Roary (without splitting
paralogs) in Chapter 2, a spreadsheet (suffix “.csv”) of gene annotations created by
Roary (with split paralogs) in Chapter 3, a spreadsheet (suffix “.tsv”) of outputs
from the fitPagel function in phytools, and a spreadsheet (suffix “.tsv”) of combined
annotations from Roary and BLAST.
